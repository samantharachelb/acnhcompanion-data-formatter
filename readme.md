# ACNH Companion Data Formatter

Formats the JSON data from the google sheets into an aesthetically pleasing JSON output. 
That same formatted output can also be used with mongodb later.

A spreadsheet containing all of the relevant spawn rate data can be found 
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AdHpfKIAVst9pOIoXPNN4kN8sGlxReSEKogo7ypdVKM/edit?usp=sharing).
